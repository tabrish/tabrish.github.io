I am an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow and a Humboldt Research Fellow in mathematics at the University of Hamburg, hosted by Reinhard Diestel. I received my PhD in applied and computational mathematics from Princeton University in 2023, where I was advised by Maria Chudnovsky. My PhD thesis was in structural graph theory; here is a [video](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Explaining%20treewidth%20through%20the%20Traveling%20Salesman%20Problem%2C%20Tara%20Abrishami%2C%20GS%20%20(2278472)/1_54cmvif1/297780972) I made explaining my thesis research to general audiences. 

I'm interested in graph theory, combinatorics, and optimization, and, more broadly, discrete mathematics and its applications. Iâ€™m also excited about the intersection of mathematics and social impact, lately in the areas of math + fairness and math + food systems. 

Outside of math, I enjoy climbing, aerial arts, writing, and [building communities around shared values](https://twod.princeton.edu/).
