I am a first-year PhD student in mathematics at [Princeton University](pacm.princeton.edu). My interests are in discrete math, particularly graph theory, combinatorics, and optimization. My CV is here.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 2019 with bachelor's degrees in mathematics and applied mathematics and a master's degree in applied mathematics. I wrote my master's thesis on the combinatorial properties of the Laplacian eigenvalues of cographs.

Outside of math, I enjoy writing short stories, traveling, playing strategic [board games](https://www.playwerewolf.co/), and eating vegan food.
