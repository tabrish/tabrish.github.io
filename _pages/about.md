I am an NSF Postdoc at Stanford University. From 2023 to 2025, I was an NSF Postdoc and a Humboldt Research Fellow in mathematics at the University of Hamburg. In Spring 2025, I was also a visiting postdoc in the [Extremal Combinatorics](https://www.slmath.org/programs/375) program at SLMath (formerly MSRI). I received my PhD in applied and computational mathematics from Princeton University in 2023. 

I'm interested in graph theory, algorithms, combinatorics, and, more broadly, discrete mathematics and its applications. A list of my papers and preprints can be found on my [arXiv author page](https://arxiv.org/a/abrishami_t_1.html) or my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6z6Pjt0AAAAJ&hl=en). You can also learn about my recent work by reading my [posts](https://tabrish.github.io/year-archive/) or watching my [recorded talks](https://tabrish.github.io/talks/).
