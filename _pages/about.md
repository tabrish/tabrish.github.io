I am a first-year PhD student in mathematics at [Princeton University](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/). My interests are in discrete math, particularly graph theory, combinatorics, and optimization. My CV is here.

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 2019 with bachelor's degrees in mathematics and applied mathematics and a master's degree in applied mathematics. I did my research and [thesis](https://tabrish.github.io/files/thesis.pdf) on the combinatorial properties of the Laplacian eigenvalues of cographs.

Outside of math, I enjoy writing short stories, traveling, playing strategic board games, and eating vegan food. While I was in college, I was an artist-in-residence at [Crater Lake National Park](https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm), studied abroad in Strasbourg, France, and worked as a mathematics researcher in the U.K.

This summer, I am a graduate fellow at the [Voting Rights Data Institute](http://gerrydata.org).
