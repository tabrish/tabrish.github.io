I received my PhD in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Princeton University in 2023, where I was advised by Maria Chudnovsky. In Fall 2023, I will be an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow and a Humboldt Research Fellow at the University of Hamburg, hosted by Reinhard Diestel. I'm interested in graph theory and combinatorics, and, more broadly, discrete mathematics and its applications. My PhD thesis was in structural graph theory, specifically induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth. Here is a [video](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Explaining%20treewidth%20through%20the%20Traveling%20Salesman%20Problem%2C%20Tara%20Abrishami%2C%20GS%20%20(2278472)/1_54cmvif1/297780972) I made explaining my thesis research to general audiences.  

Outside of math, I am a climber, an aerialist, a writer, and a vegan food enthusiast.
