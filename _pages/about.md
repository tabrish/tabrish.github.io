I am a fourth-year PhD student in mathematics at Princeton University, planning to graduate in May 2023. My interests are in discrete math, particularly graph theory, combinatorics, and optimization. I am advised by [Maria Chudnovsky](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~mchudnov/). My current research focuses on problems in structural graph theory, specifically induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth. Links to my papers and preprints can be found on my Research page. 

In addition to structural graph theory, I sometimes think about Laplacian eigenvalues of cographs (about which I wrote my [master's thesis](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/61684/ABRISHAMI-THESIS-2019.pdf) at Johns Hopkins University), and about the mathematics of gerrymandering. 

Outside of math, I enjoy climbing, hiking, traveling, playing board games, and making vegan food with my wonderful [co-op](https://twod.princeton.edu/).
