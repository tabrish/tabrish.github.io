I am an NSF Postdoc and a Humboldt Research Fellow in mathematics at the University of Hamburg, hosted by Reinhard Diestel. During Spring 2025, I am a visiting postdoc in the [Extremal Combinatorics](https://www.slmath.org/programs/375) program at SLMath (formerly MSRI). I received my PhD in applied and computational mathematics from Princeton University in 2023, where I was advised by Maria Chudnovsky. 

I'm interested in graph theory, algorithms, combinatorics, and, more broadly, discrete mathematics and its applications. You can learn about my recent work through my [posts](https://tabrish.github.io/year-archive/), or more formally [here](https://tabrish.github.io/research/). If you prefer watching videos, here are three very different videos of me speaking about my work: 
* a [4-minute overview](https://vimeo.com/1054256827) of my current research interests (Feb 2025)
* a [1.5-hour seminar talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2TdDfeQJus) on my paper about locally chordal graphs (Nov 2024)
* a [3-minute-thesis video](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Explaining%20treewidth%20through%20the%20Traveling%20Salesman%20Problem%2C%20Tara%20Abrishami%2C%20GS%20%20(2278472)/1_54cmvif1/297780972) explaining my PhD research in everyday language (May 2023)
