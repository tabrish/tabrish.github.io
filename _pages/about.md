I am a first-year PhD student in mathematics at [Princeton University](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/). My interests are in discrete math, particularly graph theory, combinatorics, and optimization. I am advised by [Maria Chudnovsky](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~mchudnov/). My current research focuses on problems in structural graph theory. Links to my papers and preprints can be found on my Research page. 

I graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 2019 with bachelor's degrees in mathematics and applied mathematics and a master's degree in applied mathematics. I did my research and [thesis](https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/bitstream/handle/1774.2/61684/ABRISHAMI-THESIS-2019.pdf) on the combinatorial properties of the Laplacian eigenvalues of cographs.

Outside of math, I enjoy writing short stories, traveling, playing board games, and making vegan food with my wonderful [co-op](https://twod.princeton.edu/). While I was in college, I was an artist-in-residence at [Crater Lake National Park](https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm), studied abroad in Strasbourg, France, and worked as a mathematics researcher in the U.K.
