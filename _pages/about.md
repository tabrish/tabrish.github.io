I am an NSF Postdoc and a Humboldt Research Fellow in mathematics at the University of Hamburg, hosted by Reinhard Diestel. During Spring 2025, I am a visiting postdoc in the [Extremal Combinatorics](https://www.slmath.org/programs/375) program at SLMath/MSRI. I received my PhD in applied and computational mathematics from Princeton University in 2023, where I was advised by Maria Chudnovsky. My PhD thesis was in structural graph theory; here is a [video](https://mediacentral.princeton.edu/media/Explaining%20treewidth%20through%20the%20Traveling%20Salesman%20Problem%2C%20Tara%20Abrishami%2C%20GS%20%20(2278472)/1_54cmvif1/297780972) I made explaining my thesis research using everyday language. 

I'm interested in graph theory, algorithms, combinatorics, and, more broadly, discrete mathematics and its applications. You can learn about my recent work through my [posts](https://tabrish.github.io/year-archive/), or more formally [here](https://tabrish.github.io/research/).
